I used these photointerrupter modules for the tachometer:

They included a slotted disc with 20 slots.

The modules have to be modified.  See the images "circuit1.png" and "module1.png" in this folder.

Remove the part marked C1, then replace the part marked R1 with a 750 ohm resistor.

Those two changes will make the output reliable up to 20000 RPM and symmetrical at all speeds.
