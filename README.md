# Bigfoot
Bigfoot is a sewing machine motor speed control made to truly control the speed rather than merely regulating the power.

It uses feedback through a tachometer and a PID controller to maintain the speed set by the foot pedal.  A sewing machine with a Bigfoot controller can steadily work its way through thick stacked leather - provided you are using a solid old vintage sewing machine.

Here's Bigfoot and the Adler working through eight, then two, then four layers of fake leather while maintaining a steady speed:
